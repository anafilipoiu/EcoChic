                        The way we live impacts the world around us. From the clothes we wear to 
                        the food we eat and the energy we use, every choice we make leaves a footprint 
                        on the planet. But here’s the good news: small, conscious changes can lead to 
                        a massive difference. That’s why we created EcoChic—a platform dedicated to making 
                        sustainable living easy, practical, and stylish.

                    <p class="text">
                        The environmental problems are at their increase on our dear planet. 
                        Our landfills are overflowing with garbage; our oceans are polluted 
                        with plastic, the reputation of industries continues to deplete natural 
                        resources with high rate. The fashion industry alone is producing as 
                        high as 92 million tons waste every year, and on the average a family 
                        wastes almost 30% of the food that they buy. The effects of climate change 
                        are accelerating, and this will certainly be inherited to the future 
                        generations in a world that has no resemblance to life as we know it.
                        However, it is not only about problems; there are also solutions. 
                        Sustainability is a process of making better choices in our lives. 
                        There is nothing like perfect sustainability. It means going as far as 
                        possible—whether that means using reusable products, reducing water 
                        consumption, using ethical fashion, or simply learning more about how 
                        to protect the environment-every little helps.
